# Hey.

Without getting pedantic or decimating the conscious by recapitulating the
 [many virtues] of a _static_, _strong_, _lazy_, _beard-infused_ language . .
 let's just say --- I'm in. No more fence sitting. This is it, for real this time.

I guess; the logical starting place is getting something spun up
- _begin at the beginning_

Then, we can incrementally munch away at the towering ivory visage of 
white-paper extolling, type inferring, etc.

"There will be a bit of math"

Maybe, maybe not. Speaking of, the **MAYBE** monad is probably a good
place to start. Rebuke the traps of abandoned control paths. We're gonna
learn us to Haskell.
